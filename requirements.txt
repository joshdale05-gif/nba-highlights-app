# yet compatible with Python 3.13 and results in an undefined symbol error
# (_PyInterpreterState_Get).  psycopg provides a modern DBAPI 2.0 driver for
# PostgreSQL that works with Python 3.13.  The "binary" extra ensures that
# pre‑built wheels are installed, avoiding the need to compile C extensions.
